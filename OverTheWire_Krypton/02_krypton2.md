***The password for level 2 is in the file ‘krypton2’. It is ‘encrypted’ using a simple rotation. It is also in non-standard ciphertext format. When using alpha characters for cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters, regardless of word boundaries. This helps obfuscate any patterns. This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to the cipher text. Enjoy!***

As stated in the description for accessing krypton1, all files for the levels are located in a directory called /krypton/.

**`krypton1@bandit:~$ cd /krypton/`**  
**`krypton1@bandit:/krypton$ ls`**  
*`krypton1  krypton2  krypton3  krypton4  krypton5  krypton6`*  
**`krypton1@bandit:/krypton$ cd krypton1`**  
**`krypton1@bandit:/krypton/krypton1$ ls`**  
*`krypton2  README`*  
**`krypton1@bandit:/krypton/krypton1$ cat README`**  
```

The first level is easy.  The password for level 2 is in the file
'krypton2'.  It is 'encrypted' using a simple rotation called ROT13.
It is also in non-standard ciphertext format.  When using alpha characters for
cipher text it is normal to group the letters into 5 letter clusters,
regardless of word boundaries.  This helps obfuscate any patterns.

This file has kept the plain text word boundaries and carried them to
the cipher text.

Enjoy!

This description differs slightly than the one provided above, which is directly from the website, in that it specifies that the file is encrypted using a ROT13. We dealt with one of these in Bandit, so this should be straightforward.

**`krypton1@bandit:/krypton/krypton1$ cat krypton2`**  
*`YRIRY GJB CNFFJBEQ EBGGRA`*  
**`krypton1@bandit:/krypton/krypton1$ echo "YRIRY GJB CNFFJBEQ EBGGRA" | tr [A-Z] [N-ZA-M]`**  
*`LEVEL TWO PASSWORD ROTTEN`*
